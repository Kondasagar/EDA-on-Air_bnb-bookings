We have Airbnb data which comprises information about host, neighbourhood, room type, price, reviews and availability. By exploring the data we can come to some conclusions.The steps involved in this process are

1. loading the data or reading the data
2. cleaning the data
3. Manipulate the data if necessary
4. EDA
5. Conclusions from EDA.


**conclusions:**

1. Broklin: Hosts are proving more number of private rooms than Entire home/apt and shared rooms
2. Manhattan: Hosts are providing more number of Entire home/apt than the number of private rooms
3. Queens: Hosts are providing more number of private rooms compared to entire home/apt.
4. Bronx: Hosts are providing more number of private rooms compared to entire home/apt.
5. Staten Island: Hosts are providing more number of private rooms compared to entire home/apt.
6. Compared to shared rooms, the hosts are providing Entire home/apt and private room.
7. People prefer to stay in Queens and, after that, they are preferring to stay in Manhattan.
8. The locations or neighbourhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn are more compared to other neighbourhood groups. So the people's traffic/density is more in Manhattan and b    Brooklyn. The reason behind this is in those two places, hosts are providing more number of private rooms and entire home/apt.
9. In Manhattan, around 8088 rooms are not availble throughout the year.
